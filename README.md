# üìä Data Analysis Project

Welcome to my data analysis project repository! In this project, I've tackled several questions using various tools and techniques. Let's dive into the details:

## Questions Solved

1. **Epoch Timestamp Conversion**:
   - Utilized Tableau Calculated field to convert epoch timestamps into datetime and date values.
   - üìà [View: Epoch Timestamp Conversion](https://github.com/Abirgit44/Data_Analysis_Assignment_June/tree/main/Question_1_Calculated_Field)

2. **Excel Formula Constraints**:
   - Copied the link provided to solve sheets (Sheet2, Sheet3, Sheet4) for achieving the "Desired Result" sheet format.
   - Applied *THE FORMULA* exclusively without copy-pasting.
   - Achieved the desired result with formulas in just one cell.
   - üìä [Watch: Excel Formula Changes](https://github.com/Abirgit44/Data_Analysis_Assignment_June/blob/main/Question_2_excel_desired_result/Assignment%20for%20Data%20Analyst%20Role(solved).xlsx)

3. **Python Date Wrangling**:
   - Employed Python for wrangling date, device, issues, and organization data.
   - Transformed the data to achieve the desired format.

4. **Dashboard Creation**:
   - Built a comprehensive dashboard in Tableau, highlighting KPIs for five departments.
   - Chose suitable visualizations and KPIs to represent departmental performance.
   - Though this could be improved much well with more complex visualizations but because of time constraints this is what I have managed to get.
